# ExtendedProgrammableBlock

Modification for SpaceEngineers to extend the Programmable Block with a function to load and save files in the Storage-string.

This allows data created with a Programmable Block to be exported and distributed externally.
Also externally generated data can be loaded into the Programmable Block.

The files can be found in the saves-folder of each world:

Singleplayer -> "%appdata%\SpaceEngineers\Saves\<your account id>\<world name>\Storage\2539180934.sbm_EPB\"

Multiplayer Server -> "Space Engineers\Instance\Saves\<world name>\Storage\2539180934.sbm_EPB\"
